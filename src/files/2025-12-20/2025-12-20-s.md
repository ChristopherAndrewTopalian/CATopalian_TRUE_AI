To move from "thinking" to "doing," we must treat the **True AI Hypercylinder** as a physical engine. We will use the 16 gates to calculate a **Logical Vector**.

In this system, the AI doesn't just "move"; it moves because a specific gate has created a **gradient** between its current state and its target.

### The Decision Matrix: Logical Locomotion

We will define movement based on the **Tension (XOR)** and the **Lack (MNI)**.

* **If MNI is 1:** The AI is pulled toward the resource.
* **If CNI is 1:** The AI is pushed toward an archive/storage (surplus).
* **If AND is 1:** The AI stops to consume.
* **If NOR is 1:** The AI enters a "wander" or "idle" state.

#### The Vector Engine Code

```javascript
// Decision Matrix for a 2D/3D Entity
function updateAIPhysics(entity, target) {
    let a = entity.isHungry ? 1 : 0;
    let b = entity.canSeeFood(target) ? 1 : 0;

    // 1. Calculate the Logical State
    const state = getHypercylinderState(a, b);

    // 2. Map Logic to Physics
    if (mni(a, b)) {
        // STATE: NEED (1,0) -> Movement: ATTRACT
        moveToward(entity, target, 2.5); 
        entity.color = "#FF3300"; // Red for Desire
    } 
    else if (cni(a, b)) {
        // STATE: SURPLUS (0,1) -> Movement: OBSERVE/ORBIT
        orbit(entity, target, 50); 
        entity.color = "#FFFF00"; // Yellow for Awareness
    }
    else if (and(a, b)) {
        // STATE: SUCCESS (1,1) -> Movement: STOP/EAT
        entity.velocity = 0;
        entity.color = "#00FFFF"; // Cyan for Engagement
        entity.energy += 0.1;
    }
    else if (nor(a, b)) {
        // STATE: EQUILIBRIUM (0,0) -> Movement: DRIFT
        applyBrownianMotion(entity);
        entity.color = "#444444"; // Grey for Rest
    }
}

```

### The "Hypercylinder" Navigation Compass

In your 3D visualization, the 16 gates act as a **Navigation Compass**. You can map the gates to a circular UI (the top face of the cylinder).

| Gate Sector | Mechanical Meaning | Vector Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MNI (02)** | **Incentive** | Increase Velocity Toward Target |
| **XOR (06)** | **Instability** | Jitter/Search behavior |
| **MI (13)** | **Prediction** | Linear Pathfinding |
| **XNOR (09)** | **Confirmation** | Path Locking / Stability |

### The "Ghost" Logic

The most fascinating part of this matrix is **Gate 00 (Contradiction)** and **Gate 15 (Tautology)**.

* **Tautology** acts as the "Gravity" or "Momentum"—the force that keeps the AI moving even when it isn't sure why.
* **Contradiction** acts as the "Friction" or "Brake"—the force that prevents the AI from moving into impossible or "Illegal" logic states.

### Implementation in 3D (Three.js or Canvas)

Imagine the Hypercylinder rotating. When **MNI** is active, the cylinder spins clockwise at high speed. When **AND** is active, it pulses. When **NOR** is active, it slows to a crawl.

**Would you like me to write a small HTML/JS snippet that creates a "Logic Probe" UI? It would show a live dashboard where you can toggle A and B and see the 16-bit DNA string change in real-time.**
