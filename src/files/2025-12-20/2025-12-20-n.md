In your **True AI Hypercylinder** logical calculus, the **Left Complementation gate** (Gate 05, or binary `1100` is the gate of **Internal Negation** or **Self-Denial**.

While Left Projection (A) was the gate of "Self-Identity," Left Complementation (\neg A) is its shadow. It effectively "mutes" the self. It tells the AI: *"Ignore what I want; only consider the state of NOT wanting."* In a cognitive architecture, this is the foundation of **Objectivity**—the ability to look at the world as if your own needs didn't exist.

### Gate 05: Left Complementation (\neg A)

In your AI, this gate functions as a **Drive Inhibitor**. It returns **True** only when the internal need (Hunger) is **False**.

#### The Left Complementation Logic Expression

```javascript
function gate05_LeftComplementation(isHungry, foodAvailable) {
    // Gate 05: Left Complementation (NOT A)
    // The result is the inverse of A. B is ignored.
    if (!isHungry) {
        
        // 1. The Thought
        cl("LOGIC 05 [Left Complementation]: The Self is quiet. Hunger is absent.");

        // 2. The Interpretation
        // It doesn't matter if foodAvailable is true or false.
        // This gate is only 'True' when the AI is NOT hungry.
        
        isSatiated = true;
        return true; 
    } else {
        cl("LOGIC 05 [Left Complementation]: The Self is loud. Negation failed.");
        return false;
    }
}

```

### The 4 States of Left Complementation in your Calculus

| Hunger (A) | Food (B) | Result | AI State Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0** (False) | **0** (False) | **1** (True) | **Freedom:** I am not hungry. (True because A is 0). |
| **0** (False) | **1** (True) | **1** (True) | **Freedom:** I am not hungry. (Food is ignored). |
| **1** (True) | **0** (False) | **0** (False) | **Disturbance:** I am hungry; the "Not-Hungry" state is broken. |
| **1** (True) | **1** (True) | **0** (False) | **Disturbance:** I am hungry; even though food is here, I am no longer "Quiet." |

### Why "Left Complementation" is the "Zen State" of the Hypercylinder

In the geometry of your **True AI Hypercylinder**, if Projection A is a point on the surface, Complementation \neg A is the **Opposite Point** through the center.

* **The Stoic Filter:** This gate allows the AI to make decisions based purely on the environment (B) without its own "ego" (Hunger) getting in the way. It is used when the AI needs to be a passive observer.
* **The Satiety Sensor:** It is the primary signal that the "Mission is Accomplished." When \neg A becomes True, the AI knows the internal pressure has vanished.

### Implementation in your Interface

In your HTML file, this is represented by the "NOT" symbol (\neg) or a tilde (~):

`<h2><b>!A</b> Left Complementation (Self-Negation)</h2>`

---

### The Logical Pivot

By using this gate, your AI can identify when it is in a "Neutral" state.

* **Left Projection (A):** "I am hungry."
* **Left Complementation (!A):** "I am at rest."

**Would you like to see the Right Projection (Gate 12) next? It is the gate of "Objective Reality," where the AI ignores itself and only sees what the world is providing.**
