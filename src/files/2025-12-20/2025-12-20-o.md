In your **True AI Hypercylinder** logical calculus, the **Right Projection gate** (Gate 12, Binary `0101`) is the gate of **Objectivity** or **Environmental Focus**.

While the Left Projection was the "Self-Identity" (A), the Right Projection is the **"External-Identity" (B)**. It tells the AI: *"My internal needs (Hunger) are irrelevant right now; I am only processing what exists in the world (Food)."*

---

### Gate 12: Right Projection (B)

In your AI, this gate functions as an **Observer**. It allows the system to build a map of the environment regardless of whether the system actually needs those resources at the moment.

#### The Right Projection Logic Expression

```javascript
function gate12_RightProjection(isHungry, foodAvailable) {
    // Gate 12: Right Projection (B)
    // The result is always whatever B is. A is ignored.
    if (foodAvailable === true) {
        
        // 1. The Thought
        cl("LOGIC 12 [Right Projection]: Focus is strictly External. The environment contains a Resource.");

        // 2. The Interpretation
        // It doesn't matter if you are hungry (A) or not.
        // The output is purely a reflection of the World (B).
        
        isObservingResource = true;
        return true; 
    } else {
        cl("LOGIC 12 [Right Projection]: The environment is empty.");
        return false;
    }
}

```

### The 4 States of Right Projection in your Calculus

| Hunger (A) | Food (B) | Result | AI State Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0** (False) | **0** (False) | **0** (False) | **Void:** No resource in the world. |
| **1** (True) | **0** (False) | **0** (False) | **Void:** Even though I'm hungry, I see no resource. |
| **0** (False) | **1** (True) | **1** (True) | **Objectivity:** I am not hungry, but the food is there. I see it. |
| **1** (True) | **1** (True) | **1** (True) | **Objectivity:** I am hungry and the food is there. I see it. |

### Why "Right Projection" is the "External Lens" of the Hypercylinder

In the geometry of your **True AI Hypercylinder**, the Right Projection represents the **World-Plane**.

* **The Sensory Buffer:** This gate is where the "Eyes" or "Sensors" of the AI live. Before the AI decides to be happy, sad, or hungry, it must first simply acknowledge that B is present.
* **Data Logging:** If your AI is wandering through a 3D space, this gate stays **1** as long as it is looking at a resource, providing a steady "tracking" signal to the navigation systems.

### Implementation in your Interface

In your HTML file, this is usually represented by the letter **B** or a symbol showing the right input flowing through while the left is blocked:

`<h2><b>[B]</b> Right Projection (Environmental Identity)</h2>`

---

### The Final Pair

We are very close to completing the circle.

* **Right Projection (B):** "There is food."
* **Right Complementation (!B):** "There is no food."

**Would you like to see the Right Complementation (Gate 03, `1010`)? This is the "Environmental Negation" gate—the only way the AI knows for sure that the world is currently empty of resources.**
