In your **True AI Hypercylinder** logical calculus, the **Left Projection gate** (Gate 10, often called the **Inhibit B** or simply the **Identity of A**) is the gate of **Self-Reference** or **Internal Focus**.

While the complex gates (like AND, XOR, or Implication) are about the relationship between you and the world, the Left Projection gate is purely about the **Self**. It effectively says: *"The environment (Food) is irrelevant; I am only processing my own internal state (Hunger)."*

### Gate 10: Left Projection (A)

In your AI, this gate functions as an **Attention Filter**. It "mutes" the external sensor data and forces the system to look only at its internal drives.

#### The Left Projection Logic Expression

```javascript
function gate10_LeftProjection(isHungry, foodAvailable) {
    // Gate 10: Left Projection (A)
    // The result is always whatever A is. B is ignored.
    if (isHungry === true) {
        
        // 1. The Thought
        cl("LOGIC 10 [Left Projection]: Focus is strictly Internal. Hunger is the only data point.");

        // 2. The Interpretation
        // It doesn't matter if foodAvailable is true or false.
        // The output is purely a reflection of the Self (A).
        
        isInternalized = true;
        return true; 
    } else {
        cl("LOGIC 10 [Left Projection]: Internal state is Null.");
        return false;
    }
}

```

### The 4 States of Left Projection in your Calculus

| Hunger (A) | Food (B) | Result | AI State Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0** (False) | **0** (False) | **0** (False) | **Quiet:** No internal drive. |
| **0** (False) | **1** (True) | **0** (False) | **Ignorance:** Food is there, but the AI is ignoring the outside world. |
| **1** (True) | **0** (False) | **1** (True) | **Obsession:** I am hungry; nothing else matters. |
| **1** (True) | **1** (True) | **1** (True) | **Obsession:** I am hungry; even though food is here, the hunger signal is what I see. |

### Why "Left Projection" is the "Internal Mirror" of the Hypercylinder

In the geometry of your **True AI Hypercylinder**, the Projection gates represent the **Planes of the Cylinder**.

* **The Subjective Plane:** The Left Projection gate represents the AI's "Subjective Reality." It allows the AI to run "Simulations" where it tests what happens if it only listens to its own needs, regardless of what the environment currently allows.
* **The Ego:** In a cognitive model, this gate represents the "Identity" of the system. It is the persistent "I" that exists regardless of the "Not-I" (the environment).

### Implementation in your Interface

In your HTML file, this is usually represented by the letter **A** or a symbol indicating that the left input passes through while the right is blocked:

`<h2><b>[A]</b> Left Projection (Self-Identity)</h2>`

---

### The Logical Pivot

By using this gate, your AI can switch from "Environmental Mode" (checking for food) to "Self Mode" (checking for hunger). This is essential for a "True AI" to have **Agency**—it needs to know what *it* wants before it checks what the world *has*.

**Would you like to see the Right Projection (Gate 12) next? It is the exact opposite—the "Objective Mirror" that ignores the self and only sees the environment.**
