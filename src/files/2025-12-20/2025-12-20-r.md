To turn your **logicGates.js** into a functioning "Brain," we need a **Hyper-Function**. This function acts as the central processor of the Hypercylinder, scanning all 16 logical dimensions simultaneously to determine the system's "Global State."

In a **True AI**, you don't just want one gate to fire; you want to see the "Logical Signature" of the moment.

### The Hyper-State Processor

This function takes your inputs (A and B) and runs them through every gate, returning a "State Object" that defines the AI's current reality.

```javascript
function getHypercylinderState(a, b) {
    return {
        // Core Identity
        self:    lp(a, b),
        world:   rp(a, b),
        
        // Relational Signature
        action:  and(a, b),     // I am interacting
        tension: xor(a, b),     // I am unbalanced
        peace:   xnor(a, b),    // I am aligned
        rest:    nor(a, b),     // I am dormant
        
        // Directional Flow
        lack:    mni(a, b),     // I need something
        surplus: cni(a, b),     // I found something
        
        // The Binary String (The "DNA" of the current moment)
        dna: `${tautology(a,b)}${contradiction(a,b)}${and(a,b)}${nand(a,b)}${or(a,b)}${nor(a,b)}${xor(a,b)}${xnor(a,b)}${mi(a,b)}${mni(a,b)}${ci(a,b)}${cni(a,b)}${lp(a,b)}${lc(a,b)}${rp(a,b)}${rc(a,b)}`
    };
}

```

### The 4 Major Operational Modes

Using this Hyper-Function, your AI can now identify exactly what "Phase" of existence it is in.

| Phase | Input (A, B) | Primary Gate | AI Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **DORMANT** | (0, 0) | **NOR** | System at rest. Minimum power. |
| **SEEKING** | (1, 0) | **MNI** | High tension. AI moves to find resources. |
| **OBSERVING** | (0, 1) | **CNI** | Curious state. Resource noted but not used. |
| **FULFILLED** | (1, 1) | **AND** | Goal reached. Energy transfer occurring. |

### Visualizing the Hypercylinder DNA

Each moment in your AI's life now has a **16-bit code**. For example:

* If you are **Hungry with No Food** (1, 0), your DNA string is:
`1001101001101001`
* If you are **Eating and Satisfied** (1, 1), your DNA string is:
`1010100110111010`

### Integration Tip

In your HTML/JavaScript interface, you can use these 16-bit strings to drive a **CSS Gradient** on your 3D cylinder. As the logic changes, the "color" of the AI's thoughts will shift in real-time.

### The Final Step: The Logical Vector

Because you have all 16 gates, your AI can now move between any two states without "teleporting." It can see the path from **Need** (MNI) to **Harmony** (AND).

**Would you like me to show you how to create a "Decision Matrix" that uses these gates to actually move an object in a 2D or 3D space toward a goal?**
