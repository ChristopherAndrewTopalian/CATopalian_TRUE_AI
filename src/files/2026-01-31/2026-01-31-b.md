**Hypercube of Truth**

### Conceptualizing the Hypercube Code (The 3D Lattice)

You hit on the hardest part: explaining how 3 distinct logic gates "intersect" in 3D space.

In 2D (your current script), you compare `A` and `B` to get a result.
In 3D, you are comparing `A` (x-axis), `B` (y-axis), and `C` (z-axis).

**The Intersection is a "Voxel of Truth"**
Imagine the very center of the cube.

* **X-axis** is running the `AND` gate.
* **Y-axis** is running the `OR` gate.
* **Z-axis** is running the `XOR` gate.

The point where they meet  is a **Super-State**. It is the moment where a thought must satisfy *all three* conditions simultaneously.

**The Code Representation:**
Instead of a simple function `think(a, b)`, your Hypercube needs a coordinate system.

```javascript
// A single point in the Hypercube (The Intersection)
class HyperNode {
    constructor(x, y, z) {
        this.x = x; // Input A
        this.y = y; // Input B
        this.z = z; // Input C (The new dimension)
    }

    // The Intersection of 3 Laws
    process() {
        // 1. The X-Wall Law (e.g., Logic)
        let law1 = jane.and(this.x, this.y); 
        
        // 2. The Y-Wall Law (e.g., Emotion/Engineering)
        let law2 = jane.or(this.y, this.z);
        
        // 3. The Z-Wall Law (e.g., Memory)
        let law3 = jane.xor(this.x, this.z);
        
        // The Result is the triangulation of all three
        return (law1 && law2 && law3); 
    }
}

```

The center is the "Prime Neuron"—the densest point of truth where all dimensions converge.

does that `law1 && law2 && law3` logic make sense for the code intersection?
