You have hit on the exact concept that defines the geometry of that logic circle (the 16-gon).

The answer is **YES**, **LP/RP** are mirrors, and **LC/RC** are mirrors.

But "Mirror" in logic doesn't mean the binary numbers look like palindromes (e.g., `1001`). In Logic Gates, "Mirror" means **Swapping Input A and Input B** (also called the **Converse**).

Here is the breakdown of why they don't *look* like mirrors at first glance, but actually are.

### 1. The "Cardinal Points" (Symmetrical Gates)
You correctly identified that **Tautology, Contradiction, XOR, and XNOR** (along with **AND, NAND, OR, NOR**) are special.

These are **Symmetrical**.
*   If you check `A AND B`, it is exactly the same as `B AND A`.
*   If you check `A XOR B`, it is exactly the same as `B XOR A`.

Because swapping A and B changes nothing, they are their own mirrors. This is why they usually sit on the central vertical axis or the cardinal points of the diagram.

### 2. The "Horizontal" Pairs (Asymmetrical Gates)
The other 8 gates come in pairs. These are **Asymmetrical**.
*   If you check `A implies B` (MI), it is **NOT** the same as `B implies A` (CI).

When you look at the diagram horizontally, you are looking at the **Converse** relationship (The Mirror).

#### The LP and RP Mirror
Let's look at the Truth Table lines.
*   **LP (0011)** says: "I only care about **A**."
*   **RP (0101)** says: "I only care about **B**."

If you stand in front of a mirror and you are "A", your reflection is "B".
*   Input `1 0` (A is true, B is false) $\rightarrow$ **LP** is **1**.
*   Input `0 1` (A is false, B is true) $\rightarrow$ **RP** is **1**.

If you swap the values of A and B, LP turns into RP.

#### The LC and RC Mirror
*   **LC (1100)** says: "I want **NOT A**."
*   **RC (1010)** says: "I want **NOT B**."

Again, if you swap the inputs A and B, LC turns into RC.

### 3. The Visual Proof (The Bit Swap)
The easiest way to see the "Mirror" is to look at the **middle two bits** of the binary summary.

The Truth Table is ordered:
1.  0 0
2.  **0 1**  (B is True)
3.  **1 0**  (A is True)
4.  1 1

To "Mirror" a gate, you just swap the middle two bits (lines 2 and 3).

*   **LP** is `0` **`0 1`** `1`.
    *   *Swap the middle bits:* `0` **`1 0`** `1`.
    *   **Result:** `0101` (Which is **RP**).
*   **LC** is `1` **`1 0`** `0`.
    *   *Swap the middle bits:* `1` **`0 1`** `0`.
    *   **Result:** `1010` (Which is **RC**).
*   **MI** is `1` **`1 0`** `1`.
    *   *Swap the middle bits:* `1` **`0 1`** `1`.
    *   **Result:** `1011` (Which is **CI**).

### Summary
You are correct that the diagram connects them because they are related.
*   **Top/Bottom** usually connects **Opposites** (Inverses/NOT).
    *   *Example:* AND (0001) vs NAND (1110).
*   **Left/Right** connects **Mirrors** (Converses/Swap A&B).
    *   *Example:* LP (0011) vs RP (0101).

So, even though `0011` and `0101` don't look like visual reflections on paper, logically, **RP is the mirror reflection of LP**.
