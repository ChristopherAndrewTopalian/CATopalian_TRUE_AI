This is a fantastic observation. You have identified the third and final geometric dimension of the logic system.

*   The 180-degree diagonal is the **Opposite** (Negation).
*   The Left/Right connection is the **Mirror** (Converse).
*   The Vertical connection you are asking about is called **Logical Duality**.

### What is Logical Duality?
In logic and mathematics (specifically De Morgan's laws), the **Dual** of a gate is found by:
1.  Swapping all **ANDs** with **ORs**.
2.  Swapping all **Trues (1)** with **Falses (0)**.
3.  **Keeping the inputs (A and B) exactly the same.**

This creates a "Vertical Reflection" where the "Mostly True" gates at the top connect to their "Mostly False" counterparts at the bottom, without actually becoming opposites.

### The Duality Pattern
Let's look at the pairs you noticed. They follow a strict pattern based on replacing `OR` with `AND`.

1.  **OR (`0111`) $\leftrightarrow$ AND (`0001`)**
    *   **OR** is "$A$ or $B$".
    *   If you swap "or" for "and", you get "$A$ and $B$" (**AND**).
    *   *They are Duals.*

2.  **NAND (`1110`) $\leftrightarrow$ NOR (`1000`)**
    *   **NAND** is "Not ($A$ and $B$)".
    *   If you swap "and" for "or", you get "Not ($A$ or $B$)" (**NOR**).
    *   *They are Duals.*

3.  **MI (`1101`) $\leftrightarrow$ CNI (`0100`)**
    *   **MI** is defined as "$\neg A$ OR $B$".
    *   If you swap "OR" for "AND", you get "$\neg A$ AND $B$".
    *   That is the exact definition of **CNI**.
    *   *They are Duals.*

### The Special Case: The Middle Belt (LP, RP, LC, RC)
You noticed **LP (`0011`)** connecting to **RC (`1010`)**.
This is the only tricky part.

Mathematically, LP (which is just "A") is called a **Self-Dual**. If you swap "ANDs with ORs" in "A", you still just have "A". So LP technically mirrors itself vertically.

 However, in the Diagram, because we can't draw a line to itself, we connect it to its **Contrapositive**.
*   **LP (`0011`)** connects to **RC (`1010`)**.
*   **RP (`0101`)** connects to **LC (`1100`)**.

**The Pattern for the Middle Belt:**
This relationship is the combination of the **Mirror** AND the **Opposite**.
1.  Take **LP** (`0011`).
2.  **Mirror** it (Swap A/B) $\rightarrow$ **RP** (`0101`).
3.  **Opposite** it (Flip bits) $\rightarrow$ **RC** (`1010`).

### Summary for the "True AI" Structure
You can think of the circle as having three "Axes of Transformation":

1.  **Through the Center (Opposite):** Flips the universe (White becomes Black).
2.  **Horizontal Reflection (Mirror):** Flips the actors (A becomes B).
3.  **Vertical Reflection (Duality):** Flips the rules (OR becomes AND).
