Your "New Idea" (the Gradient/Fullness approach) is **significantly better** for a "True AI" structure.

Here is why your new order is the correct choice, along with a slight refinement to make the geometry perfect.

### Why the New Order is Better

1.  **The "Cascade of Truth" (Gravity):**
    *   In your new idea, the Top (12:00) is **Tautology** (Full Truth, `1111`).
    *   The Bottom (6:00) is **Contradiction** (Full Falsehood, `0000`).
    *   As you move down the sides of the circle, the "Truth" slowly drains away. The rectangles go from fully white, to mostly white, to half-and-half, to mostly dark, to fully dark.
    *   This makes the diagram look like a **Hierarchy** or a **Brain**, where Truth is the highest ideal.

2.  **Horizontal Symmetry (Mirrors):**
    Your new order creates perfect horizontal relationships. If you look at the left side and the right side, they "talk" to each other perfectly.

### The Perfect Sequence (Refined)

To maximize the logic you described, here is the exact ordering you should use. This puts the **Mirrors** (A vs B) across from each other horizontally, and the **Symmetricals** (like OR/NAND) balancing each other.

**The "True AI" Gradient Order:**

*   **12:00 (Top):** Tautology (`1111`) — *All True*

*   **11:00**: MI (`1101`) $\leftrightarrow$ **01:00**: CI (`1011`) — *(Mirrors)*
*   **10:00**: NAND (`1110`) $\leftrightarrow$ **02:00**: OR (`0111`) — *(High Truth Balance)*

*   **09:00 (West)**: XNOR (`1001`) $\leftrightarrow$ **03:00 (East)**: XOR (`0110`)
    *   *This is the "Equator". It represents perfect balance (2 True, 2 False). Putting the "Exclusive" gates here acts as the horizon between Truth and Falsehood.*

*   **08:00**: LC (`1100`) $\leftrightarrow$ **04:00**: RC (`1010`) — *(Mirrors)*
*   **07:00**: LP (`0011`) $\leftrightarrow$ **05:00**: RP (`0101`) — *(Mirrors)*
    *   *(Note: You can swap rows 8/4 and 7/5 depending on if you want "NOTs" or "Transfers" higher).*

*   **06:00 (Bottom):** Contradiction (`0000`) — *All False*

### Why this is superior to the "Old Photo"
*   **The Old Photo** scattered the rectangles randomly. You had a mostly-dark rectangle next to a mostly-white one. It looked messy visually.
*   **The New Order** creates a smooth gradient. The diagram will look like it is glowing at the top and fading into shadow at the bottom. This is much more "Futuristic" and logically sound.

### Implementation
Use your new order. It aligns perfectly with the visual representation of the Rectangles (Truth Tables).

Here is the data block re-ordered for that perfect gradient:

```javascript
let logic_gates = [];
logic_gates.push(
    tautology,      // 12:00
    ci,             // 01:00
    or,             // 02:00
    xor,            // 03:00 (Cardinal East)
    rc,             // 04:00
    rp,             // 05:00
    contradiction,  // 06:00 (Bottom)
    lp,             // 07:00
    lc,             // 08:00
    xnor,           // 09:00 (Cardinal West)
    nand,           // 10:00
    mi,             // 11:00
    
    // Remaining gates (The low-truth ones need to fit in the bottom quadrant)
    // To make the circle perfect, we actually need to fit 16 items.
    // The list above is only 12 positions (clock face). 
    // You need to squeeze the remaining 4 (NOR, AND, MNI, CNI) into the bottom half.
);
```

**Correction for the 16-Gon (16 slices, not 12):**
Since there are 16 gates, they don't fit perfectly on a 12-hour clock. You simply divide the circle into 16 slices (22.5 degrees each).

**The Final 16-Gon Sequence (Clockwise from Top):**
1.  **Tautology** (Top)
2.  **CI**
3.  **OR**
4.  **RP**
5.  **XOR** (East)
6.  **RC**
7.  **MNI**
8.  **AND**
9.  **Contradiction** (Bottom)
10. **NOR**
11. **CNI**
12. **LC**
13. **XNOR** (West)
14. **LP**
15. **NAND**
16. **MI**
