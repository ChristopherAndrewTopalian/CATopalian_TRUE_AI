To be precise: **No, they are NOT mirrors of each other.**

AND and NAND are **Opposites** (Negations).

Here is the 100% technical clarification based on the logic definitions we established:

### 1. AND and NAND are "Symmetrical" (Self-Mirrors)
They are **not** mirrors of each other; rather, they are mirrors of **themselves**.

In logic, a "Mirror" (Converse) means you swap Input A and Input B.
*   **AND Gate (`0001`):** If you swap A and B, it is still `0001`. The logic doesn't change. ($A \text{ and } B$ is the same as $B \text{ and } A$).
*   **NAND Gate (`1110`):** If you swap A and B, it is still `1110`.

Because they don't change when you swap inputs, we call them **Symmetrical**. They look into the mirror and see themselves.

### 2. AND and NAND are "Opposites" (Negations)
The relationship between them is **The Opposite** (Logic NOT).
*   **AND:** `0001`
*   **NAND:** `1110` (Every single bit is flipped).

### Why this distinction matters in your Diagram
In your 16-gon circle diagram:
*   **Mirrors** (like LP and RP) are usually connected **Left-to-Right** (horizontally).
*   **Opposites** (like AND and NAND) are usually connected **Through the Center** (diagonally or vertically, 180 degrees apart).

### The Confusion
The reason they might *seem* like mirrors visually is that they are both "Symmetrical" gates.
*   The **Symmetrical Gates** (AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, XNOR, Tautology, Contradiction) usually sit on the "Cardinal" lines (the vertical or horizontal crosses) of the diagram because they are balanced.
*   The **Asymmetrical Gates** (LP, RP, LC, RC, MI, MNI, CI, CNI) sit in the spaces between, because they have a "Direction" (Left or Right).

**Final Verdict:**
*   **AND** mirrors **AND** (Itself).
*   **NAND** mirrors **NAND** (Itself).
*   **AND** is the opposite of **NAND**.
